# art with code

A project for generating art assets from JavaScript code using the Canvas API 
in the browser. My use case is making simple assets for mobile games. 

## Image dimensions
The default dimensions of the generated canvas is 512x512. 

## Saving your image file
To save your image, right click on the image and select "Save image as...". 
There's no better way to download your image file yet. 

## Why wouldn't I just script the Canvas API?
This tool has live preview and makes drawing less cluttered.
